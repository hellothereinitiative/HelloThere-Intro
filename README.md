# HelloThere-Intro
A calm, ethical social network ‚Äì no algorithms, no ads, just real human connection.
What is Hello There?
Hello There is a human-first alternative to mainstream social media. No likes. No endless scrolling. No data profiling. Just meaningful contact ‚Äî starting live and moving to digital, not the other way around.

It‚Äôs built around proximity, privacy, and ethics. Users only see posts from real, confirmed connections. No algorithms shape your feed. No ads interrupt your mind.

Why this repo?
This is a first placeholder to share the concept with potential collaborators and ethical developers. If you're someone who wants to build something fundamentally better, feel free to reach out.

Status
We're currently in early concept and protection phase (i-DEPOT protected). Looking to connect with developers or thinkers who care more about people than growth metrics.
