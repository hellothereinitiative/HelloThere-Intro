# Code of Conduct

## Our Commitment

Hello There is a human-first platform. We are committed to creating a calm, respectful, and inclusive environment for everyone, regardless of background, identity, or belief.

We welcome developers, contributors, and thinkers who align with our mission: to build ethical digital tools that support real human connection and well-being â€” not addiction, division, or manipulation.

## Expected Behavior

- Act with empathy, kindness, and respect.
- Embrace constructive dialogue, even when there is disagreement.
- Protect the privacy and dignity of all participants.
- Avoid personal attacks, discriminatory remarks, or toxic behavior.

## Unacceptable Behavior

- Harassment, hate speech, or targeted attacks.
- Disrespectful or manipulative conduct.
- Spam, self-promotion, or AI-generated noise without purpose.
- Undermining the project's ethical goals.

## Our Pledge

Anyone who violates this Code of Conduct may be removed from participation in the project and its related channels. This is a space for trust and growth.

## Reporting

To report a concern or incident, contact us privately at

All reports will be treated confidentially and taken seriously.

## Final Note

We donâ€™t measure value by lines of code, but by the **quality of contribution** and **alignment with our shared values**.  
Thank you for helping make Hello There a safe and meaningful project.
